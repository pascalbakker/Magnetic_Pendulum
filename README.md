![4 Magnets Example](https://github.com/pascalbakker/Magnetic_Pendulum/blob/master/Examples/4Magnets.png?raw=true "See /examples for more examples")

### Info
The goal of this project is to display chaos with the mangentic pendulum. 

Each purple square is a magnet.

[A quick video explaining the magnetic pendulum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe5Enm96MFQ&t=7s)

In main.c:

"k_f","k_m","k_g" are the force constants. 

To add magnets update the "magnets" array and the "numOfMagnets" variable.


### How To Execute
Execute "main.c"
