### Info
The goal of this project is to display chaos with the mangentic pendulum. 

Each purple square is a magnet. (except in the image above, where the center 0,0 is also a purple square)

[A quick video explaining the magnetic pendulum](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qe5Enm96MFQ&t=7s)

In main.c:

"k_f","k_m","k_g" are the force constants. 

To add magnets update the "magnets" array and the "numOfMagnets" variable.


### How To Execute
Execute "main.c"
